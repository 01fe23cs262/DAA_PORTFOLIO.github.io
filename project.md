# **SARNATH CITY DESIGN**
# Introduction
The Design and Analysis of Algorithms course delves into the principles of creating efficient algorithms to tackle real-world challenges. It encompasses essential concepts such as recursion, iteration, backtracking, and dynamic programming, alongside the application of data structures like trees, graphs, and heaps to address complex problems across various fields.

This course bridges the gap between algorithmic theory and practical implementation, demonstrating its relevance in areas such as optimizing transportation routes and managing large-scale business datasets.

# Course Project Overview
The project centers on identifying and addressing inefficiencies in urban planning that necessitate engineering solutions. Based on findings from a white paper, the problem domain includes challenges in traffic flow, waste management, and infrastructure design. Each team member is tasked with analyzing specific business cases and proposing algorithm-driven solutions to mitigate these issues effectively.
